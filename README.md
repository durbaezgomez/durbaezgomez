# Hi, Iâ€™m Dominik! ðŸ‘‹  

Iâ€™m a passionate **iOS Developer** with over 5 years of experience building scalable, user-focused applications using **Swift** and modern architectures like MVVM and recently - TCA. All this while spending my free time on pursuing other tech oriented interests and music production. My journey blends technology and creativity:  

- ðŸš€ **Automation Enthusiast**: I love building smart workflows with tools like **n8n**, **Make**, and **Siri Shortcuts**, streamlining processes for both work and life.  
- ðŸ¤– **AI Explorer**: Exploring the intersection of **AI** and app development, I create projects that push the boundaries of user experiences.  
- ðŸŽµ **Music Producer**: As a music producer and sound designer, I combine my technical skills with artistry, creating beats, soundscapes, and compositions.  

Check out my repositories to see projects that blend code, creativity, and automation!
